Number of processors
CONFIG_PROC_NUM
  The number of processor cores. The LEON3MP design can accomodate
  up to 4 LEON3 processor cores. Use 1 unless you know what you are
  doing ...

Force values from example configuration
CONFIG_LEON3_MIN
  If you select any other value than Custom-configuration then the
  configuration choices will be forced to settings corresponding to
  the selected example configuration. The example configurations are
  described in the document LEON/GRLIB Design and Configuration Guide
  located at doc/guide.pdf.

  Due to limitations in the configuration tool it is not possible to
  update all choices without first saving the configuration and
  restarting the tool. Perform the steps below to set the processor
  configuration to example configuration values: 

  1. Select example configuration (MIN, GP, HP). This will result
     in most processor configuration menus being disabled.
  2. Go back to the main menu and select Save and Exit
  3. Start the xconfig tool again
  4. Go into processor configuration and select Custom-configuration.
     All configuration values can now be changed again and have been
     initialized to example configuration that was selected earlier.
  5. Make any changes and then quit xconfig via Save and Exit

  Some options set from the example configuration may need to be changed.
  One such setting is the FPU multiplier, if the FPU is enabled, where
  timing is improved for several FPGA technologies by selecting the
  technology specific multiplier and where the DW multiplier is generally
  a good choice for ASIC.

Number of SPARC register windows
CONFIG_IU_NWINDOWS
  The SPARC architecture (and LEON) allows 2 - 32 register windows.
  However, any number except 8 will require that you modify and
  recompile your run-time system or kernel. Unless you know what
  you are doing, use 8.

SPARC V8 multiply and divide instruction
CONFIG_IU_V8MULDIV
  If you say Y here, the SPARC V8 multiply and divide instructions
  will be implemented. The instructions are: UMUL, UMULCC, SMUL,
  SMULCC, UDIV, UDIVCC, SDIV, SDIVCC. In code containing frequent
  integer multiplications and divisions, significant performance
  increase can be achieved. Emulated floating-point operations will
  also benefit from this option.

  By default, the gcc compiler does not emit multiply or divide
  instructions and your code must be compiled with -mv8 to see any
  performance increase. On the other hand, code compiled with -mv8
  will generate an illegal instruction trap when executed on processors
  with this option disabled.

  The divider consumes approximately 2 kgates, the multiplier 6 kgates.

Multiplier latency
CONFIG_IU_MUL_LATENCY_2
  Implementation options for the integer multiplier.

  Type        Implementation              issue-rate/latency
  2-clocks    32x32 pipelined multiplier     1/2
  4-clocks    16x16 standard multiplier      4/4
  5-clocks    16x16 pipelined multiplier     4/5

MAC operation
CONFIG_IU_MUL_MAC
  If you say Y here, the SPARC V8e UMAC/SMAC (multiply-accumulate)
  instructions will be enabled. The instructions implement a
  single-cycle 16x16->32 bits multiply with a 40-bits accumulator.
  The details of these instructions can be found in the LEON manual,
  This option is only available when 16x16 multiplier is used.

Multiplier structure
CONFIG_IU_MUL_INFERRED
  Structure options for the integer multiplier. The multiplier
  can be implemented with the following structures:

  * Inferred by the synthesis tool
  * Generated using Module Generators from NTNU
  * Using technology specific netlists (TechSpec)
  * Using Synopsys Designware (DW02_mult and DW_mult_pipe)

Branch prediction
CONFIG_IU_BP
  Enabling branch prediction will improve performance with
  up to 20%, depending on application. The timing and area
  overhead are minor, so it is recommended to always enable
  this option.

Single vector trapping
CONFIG_IU_SVT
  Single-vector trapping is a SPARC V8e option to reduce code-size
  in small applications. If enabled, the processor will jump to
  the address of trap 0 (tt = 0x00) for all traps. No trap table
  is then needed. The trap type is present in %psr.tt and must
  be decoded by the O/S. Saves 4 Kbyte of code, but increases
  trap and interrupt overhead. Currently, the only O/S supporting
  this option is eCos. To enable SVT, the O/S must also set bit 13
  in %asr17.

Load latency
CONFIG_IU_LDELAY
  Defines the pipeline load delay (= pipeline cycles before the data
  from a load instruction is available for the next instruction).
  One cycle gives best performance, but might create a critical path
  on targets with slow (data) cache memories. A 2-cycle delay can
  improve timing but will reduce performance with about 5%.

  Note that the load delay must be 1 to support the CASA instruction.

Reset address
CONFIG_IU_RSTADDR
  By default, a SPARC processor starts execution at address 0.
  With this option, any 4-kbyte aligned reset start address can be
  choosen. Keep at 0 unless you really know what you are doing.

No tagged arithmetic
CONFIG_NOTAG
  Say Y here to disable tagged arithmetic and the CASA instructions.
  This will save some area in minimal systems that do not need
  these features.

Power-down
CONFIG_PWD
  Say Y here to enable the power-down feature of the processor.
  Might reduce the maximum frequency slightly on FPGA targets.
  For details on the power-down operation, see the LEON3 manual.

Hardware watchpoints
CONFIG_IU_WATCHPOINTS
  The processor can have up to 4 hardware watchpoints, allowing to
  create both data and instruction breakpoints at any memory location,
  also in PROM. Each watchpoint will use approximately 500 gates.
  Use 0 to disable the watchpoint function.

Floating-point enable
CONFIG_FPU_ENABLE
  Say Y here to enable the floating-point interface for the MEIKO
  or GRFPU. Note that no FPU's are provided with the GPL version
  of GRLIB. Both the Gaisler GRFPU and the Meiko FPU are commercial
  cores and must be obtained separately.

FPU selection
CONFIG_FPU_GRFPU
  Select between Gaisler Research's GRFPU and GRFPU-lite FPUs or the Sun
  Meiko FPU core. All cores  are fully IEEE-754 compatible and support
  all SPARC FPU instructions.

GRFPU Multiplier
CONFIG_FPU_GRFPU_INFMUL
  On FPGA targets choose inferred multiplier. For ASIC implementations
  choose between Synopsys Design Ware (DW) multiplier or Module
  Generator (ModGen) multiplier. The DW multiplier gives better results
  (smaller area and better timing) but requires a DW license.
  The ModGen multiplier is part of GRLIB and does not require a license.
  The Technology Specific multiplier option selects a pre-designed
  multiplier using technology specific macrocells when available, else
  an inferred multiplier is used.

Shared GRFPU
CONFIG_FPU_GRFPU_SH
  If enabled multiple CPU cores will share one GRFPU.

GRFPC Configuration
CONFIG_FPU_GRFPC0
  Configures the GRFPU-LITE controller.

  In simple configuration controller executes FP instructions
  in parallel with  integer instructions. FP operands are fetched
  in the register file stage and the result is written in the write
  stage. This option uses least area resources.

  Data forwarding configuration gives ~ 10 % higher FP performance than
  the simple configuration by adding data forwarding between the pipeline
  stages.

  Non-blocking controller allows FP load and store instructions to
  execute in parallel with FP instructions. The performance increase is
  ~ 20 % for FP applications. This option uses most logic resources and
  is suitable for ASIC implementations.

Floating-point netlist
CONFIG_FPU_NETLIST
  Say Y here to use a VHDL netlist of the GRFPU-Lite. This is
  only available in certain versions of grlib.

Enable Instruction cache
CONFIG_ICACHE_ENABLE
  The instruction cache should always be enabled to allow
  maximum performance. Some low-end system might want to
  save area and disable the cache, but this will reduce
  the performance with a factor of 2 - 3.

Enable Data cache
CONFIG_DCACHE_ENABLE
  The data cache should always be enabled to allow
  maximum performance. Some low-end system might want to
  save area and disable the cache, but this will reduce
  the performance with a factor of 2 at least.

Instruction cache associativity
CONFIG_ICACHE_ASSO1
  The instruction cache can be implemented as a multi-way cache with
  1 - 4 ways. Higher associativity usually increases the cache hit
  rate and thereby the performance. The downside is higher power
  consumption and increased gate-count for tag comparators.

  Note that a 1-way cache is effectively a direct-mapped cache.

Instruction cache way size
CONFIG_ICACHE_SZ1
  The size of each way in the instuction cache (kbytes). Valid values
  are 1 - 64 in binary steps. Note that the full range is only supported
  by the generic and virtex2 targets. Most target packages are limited
  to 2 - 16 kbyte. Large way size gives higher performance but might
  affect the maximum frequency (on ASIC targets). The total instruction
  cache size is the number of way multiplied with the way size.

Instruction cache line size
CONFIG_ICACHE_LZ16
  The instruction cache line size. Can be set to either 16 or 32
  bytes per line. Instruction caches typically benefit from larger
  line sizes, but on small caches it migh be better with 16 bytes/line
  to limit eviction miss rate.

Instruction cache replacement algorithm
CONFIG_ICACHE_ALGORND
  Cache replacement algorithm for caches with 2 - 4 ways. The 'random'
  algorithm selects the way to evict randomly. The least-recently-replaced
  (LRR) algorithm evicts the way least recently replaced. The least-
  recently-used (LRU) algorithm evicts the way least recently accessed.
  The random algorithm uses a simple 1- or 2-bit counter to select
  the eviction way and has low area overhead. The LRR scheme uses one
  extra bit in the tag ram and has therefore also low area overhead.
  However, the LRR scheme can only be used with 2-way caches. The LRU
  scheme has typically the best performance but also highest area overhead.
  A 2-way LRU uses 1 flip-flop per line, a 3-way LRU uses 3 flip-flops
  per line, and a 4-way LRU uses 5 flip-flops per line to store the access
  history.

Instruction cache locking
CONFIG_ICACHE_LOCK
  Say Y here to enable cache locking in the instruction cache.
  Locking can be done on cache-line level, but will increase the
  width of the tag ram with one bit. If you don't know what
  locking is good for, it is safe to say N.

Data cache associativity
CONFIG_DCACHE_ASSO1
  The data cache can be implemented as a multi-way cache with
  1 - 4 ways. Higher associativity usually increases the cache hit
  rate and thereby the performance. The downside is higher power
  consumption and increased gate-count for tag comparators.

  Note that a 1-way cache is effectively a direct-mapped cache.

Data cache way size
CONFIG_DCACHE_SZ1
  The size of each way in the data cache (kbytes). Valid values are
  1 - 64 in binary steps. Note that the full range is only supported
  by the generic and virtex2 targets. Most target packages are limited
  to 2 - 16 kbyte. A large cache gives higher performance but the
  data cache is timing critical an a too large setting might affect
  the maximum frequency (on ASIC targets). The total data cache size
  is the number of way multiplied with the way size.

Data cache line size
CONFIG_DCACHE_LZ16
  The data cache line size. Can be set to either 16 or 32 bytes per
  line. A smaller line size gives better associativity and higher
  cache hit rate, but requires a larger tag memory.

Data cache replacement algorithm
CONFIG_DCACHE_ALGORND
  See the explanation for instruction cache replacement algorithm.

Data cache locking
CONFIG_DCACHE_LOCK
  Say Y here to enable cache locking in the data cache.
  Locking can be done on cache-line level, but will increase the
  width of the tag ram with one bit. If you don't know what
  locking is good for, it is safe to say N.

Data cache snooping
CONFIG_DCACHE_SNOOP
  Say Y here to enable data cache snooping on the AHB bus.

  With snooping, AHB writes by other masters to data that is in the
  data cache will be automatically detected and the cache line will
  be marked as invalid. This simplifies software design in systems
  with DMA units or multiple processors accessing the same memory.
  It is a requirement (together with separate snoop tags) to run
  Linux on more than one CPU.

  Depending on the separate snoop tags option, snooping will be
  implemented using either dual-port (common tags) or two-port
  RAMs (separate tags). A workaround if dual port RAMs are
  not available for the target technology is to use separate
  snoop tags even if it is not needed otherwise.

Separate snoop tags
CONFIG_DCACHE_SNOOP_SEPTAG
  Enable a separate memory to store the data tags used for snooping.
  This is necessary when snooping support is wanted in systems
  with MMU, typically for SMP systems. In this case, the snoop
  tags will contain the physical tag address while the normal
  tags contain the virtual tag address.

  When separate snoop tags are enabled, the tag RAMs will be implemented
  using two-port RAMs instead of dual-port RAMs. A workaround if
  dual port RAMs are not available for the target technology is
  therefore to use separate snoop tags even if it is not needed.

Fixed cacheability map
CONFIG_CACHE_FIXED
  If this variable is 0, the cacheable memory regions are defined
  by the AHB plug&play information (default). To overriden the
  plug&play settings, this variable can be set to indicate which
  areas should be cached. The value is treated as a 16-bit hex value
  with each bit defining if a 256 Mbyte segment should be cached or not.
  The right-most (LSB) bit defines the cacheability of AHB address
  0 - 256 MByte, while the left-most bit (MSB) defines AHB address
  3840 - 4096 MByte. If the bit is set, the corresponding area is
  cacheable. A value of 00F3 defines address 0 - 0x20000000 and
  0x40000000 - 0x80000000 as cacheable.

Local data ram
CONFIG_DCACHE_LRAM
  Say Y here to add a local ram to the data cache controller.
  Accesses to the ram (load/store) will be performed at 0 waitstates
  and store data will never be written back to the AHB bus.

Size of local data ram
CONFIG_DCACHE_LRAM_SZ1
  Defines the size of the local data ram in Kbytes. Note that most
  technology libraries do not support larger rams than 16 Kbyte.

Start address of local data ram
CONFIG_DCACHE_LRSTART
  Defines the 8 MSB bits of start address of the local data ram.
  By default set to 8f (start address = 0x8f000000), but any value
  (except 0) is possible. Note that the local data ram 'shadows'
  a 16 Mbyte block of the address space.

MMU enable
CONFIG_MMU_ENABLE
  Say Y here to enable the Memory Management Unit.

MMU split icache/dcache table lookaside buffer
CONFIG_MMU_COMBINED
  Select "combined" for a combined icache/dcache table lookaside buffer,
  "split" for a split icache/dcache table lookaside buffer

MMU tlb replacement scheme
CONFIG_MMU_REPARRAY
  Select "LRU" to use the "least recently used" algorithm for TLB
  replacement, or "Increment" for a simple incremental replacement
  scheme.

Combined i/dcache tlb
CONFIG_MMU_I2
  Select the number of entries for the instruction TLB, or the
  combined icache/dcache TLB if such is used.

Split tlb, dcache
CONFIG_MMU_D2
  Select the number of entries for the dcache TLB.

Fast writebuffer
CONFIG_MMU_FASTWB
  Only selectable if split tlb is enabled. In case fast writebuffer is
  enabled the tlb hit will be made concurrent to the cache hit. This
  leads to higher store performance, but increased power and area.

MMU pagesize
CONFIG_MMU_PAGE_4K
  The deafult SPARC V8 SRMMU page size is 4 Kbyte. This limits the
  cache way size to 4 Kbyte, and total data cache size to 16 Kbyte,
  when the MMU is used. To increase the maximum data cache size,
  the MMU pages size can be increased to up 32 Kbyte. This will
  give a maximum data cache size of 128 Kbyte.

  Note that an MMU page size different than 4 Kbyte will require
  a special linux tool-chain if glibc is used. If you don't know
  what you are doing, stay with 4 Kbyte ...

DSU enable
CONFIG_DSU_ENABLE
  The debug support unit (DSU) allows non-intrusive debugging and tracing
  of both executed instructions and AHB transfers. If you want to enable
  the DSU, say Y here and select the configuration below.

Trace buffer enable
CONFIG_DSU_TRACEBUF
  Say Y to enable the trace buffer. The buffer is not necessary for
  debugging, only for tracing instructions and data transfers.

Enable instruction tracing
CONFIG_DSU_ITRACE
  If you say Y here, an instruction trace buffer will be implemented
  in each processor. The trace buffer will trace executed instructions
  and their results, and place them in a circular buffer. The buffer
  can be read out by any AHB master, and in particular by the debug
  communication link.

Size of trace buffer
CONFIG_DSU_ITRACESZ1
  Select the buffer size (in kbytes) for the instruction trace buffer.
  Each line in the buffer needs 16 bytes. A 128-entry buffer will thus
  need 2 kbyte.

Enable AHB tracing
CONFIG_DSU_ATRACE
  If you say Y here, an AHB trace buffer will be implemented in the
  debug support unit processor. The AHB buffer will trace all transfers
  on the AHB bus and save them in a circular buffer. The trace buffer
  can be read out by any AHB master, and in particular by the debug
  communication link.

Size of trace buffer
CONFIG_DSU_ATRACESZ1
  Select the buffer size (in kbytes) for the AHB trace buffer.
  Each line in the buffer needs 16 bytes. A 128-entry buffer will thus
  need 2 kbyte.


LEON3FT enable
CONFIG_LEON3FT_EN
  Say Y here to use the fault-tolerant LEON3FT core instead of the
  standard non-FT LEON3.

IU Register file protection
CONFIG_IUFT_NONE
  Select the FT implementation in the LEON3FT integer unit
  register file. The options include parity, parity with
  sparing, 7-bit BCH and TMR.

FPU Register file protection
CONFIG_FPUFT_NONE
  Say Y to enable SEU protection of the FPU register file.
  The GRFPU-Lite will be protected with parity, PDMR and TMR.
  The GRFPU can use PDMR or TMR only.

Cache memory error injection
CONFIG_RF_ERRINJ
  Say Y here to enable error injection in to the IU/FPU regfiles.
  Affects only simulation.

Cache memory protection
CONFIG_CACHE_FT_EN
  Enable SEU error-correction in the cache memories.

Cache memory error injection
CONFIG_CACHE_ERRINJ
  Say Y here to enable error injection in to the cache memories.
  Affects only simulation.

Leon3ft netlist
CONFIG_LEON3_NETLIST
  Say Y here to use a VHDL netlist of the LEON3FT. This is
  only available in certain versions of grlib.

IU assembly printing
CONFIG_IU_DISAS
  Enable printing of executed instructions to the console.

IU assembly printing in netlist
CONFIG_IU_DISAS_NET
  Enable printing of executed instructions to the console also
  when simulating a netlist. NOTE: with this option enabled, it
  will not be possible to pass place&route.

32-bit program counters
CONFIG_DEBUG_PC32
  Since the LSB 2 bits of the program counters always are zero, they are
  normally not implemented. If you say Y here, the program counters will
  be implemented with full 32 bits, making debugging of the VHDL model
  much easier. Turn of this option for synthesis or you will be wasting
  area.
