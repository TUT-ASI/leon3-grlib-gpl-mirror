This leon3 design is tailored to the Xilinx kintex-7 KC705 board

http://www.xilinx.com/kc705

Note: This design requires that the GRLIB_SIMULATOR variable is
correctly set. Please refer to the documentation in doc/grlib.pdf for
additional information.

Note: The Vivado flow and parts of this design are still
experimental. Currently the design configuration should be left as-is.

Note: You must have both Vivado 2013.2 and Xilinx ISE 14.6 in your 
path for the make targets to work.

Simulation and synthesis
------------------------

The design uses the Xilinx MIG memory interface with an AHB-2.0
interface. The MIG source code cannot be distributed due to the
prohibitive Xilinx license, so the MIG must be re-generated with 
coregen before simulation and synthesis can be done.

Xilinx MIG interface will automatically be generated when 
Vivado is launched  

To simulate using XSIM and run systest.c on the Leon design using the memory 
controller from Xilinx use the make targets:

  make soft
  make vivado-launch

To simulate using Modelsim/Aldec and run systest.c on the Leon design using 
the memory controller from Xilinx use the make targets:

  make map_xilinx_vhdl_lib
  make vsim (only required if Modelsim is used as simulator)
  make mig_series7

Synthesis will ONLY work with Vivado 2013.02 installed or newer, and 
the XILINX variable properly set in the shell. To synthesize the design, do

  make vivado

and then use iMPACT programming tool:
  
  make ise-prog-fpga

to program the FPGA.

The MIG can be disabled either by deselecting the MIG controller in 'xconfig' or
manually editing the config.vhd file. When no MIG is present in the system normal
GRLIB flow can be used and no extra compile steps are needed. Also when when no
MIG is present it is possible to control and set the system frequency via xconfig. 
Note that the system frequency can be modified via Xilinx Coregen when the 
MIG is present.

Compiling and launching modelsim when no memory controller is present:

  make vsim
  make vsim-launch

Simulation options
------------------

All options are set either by editing the testbench or specify/modify the generic 
default value when launching the simulator. For Modelsim use the option "-g" i.e.
to enable processor disassembly to console launch modelsim with the option: "-gdisas=1"

USE_MIG_INTERFACE_MODEL - Use MIG simulation model for faster simulation run time

disas - Enable processor disassembly to console

DEBUG - Enable extra debug information when using Micron DDR3 models

Design specifics
----------------

* Synthesis should be done using Vivado 2013.02 or newer

* The DDR3 controller is implemented with Xilinx MIG Series7 2.0 and 
  runs of the 200 MHz clock. The DDR3 memory runs at 400 MHz
  (DDR3-800). grmon-2.0.30-74 or later is needed to detect the
   DDR3 memory.

* The AHB clock is generated by the MMCM module in the DDR3
  controller, and can be controlled via Coregen. When the 
  MIG DDR3 controller isn't present the AHB clock is generated
  from CLKGEN, and can be controlled via xconfig

* System reset is mapped to the EAST button
  (This is since the CPU RESET button pin is used for DDR VTP)

* DSU break is mapped to GPIO east button

* LED 0 indicates processor in debug mode

* LED 1 indicates processor in error mode, execution halted

* LED 2 indicates DDR3 PHY initialization done (Only valid when MIG is present)

* LED 3 indicates internal PLL has locked (Only valid when MIG isn't present)

* 16-bit flash prom can be read at address 0. It can be programmed
  with GRMON version 2.0.30-74 or later.

* The system can be simulated with xilinxs memory interface in normal or fast mode.
  For normal mode i.e. with the MIG IP and Memory models from MICRON all simulaion libraries
  needs to be installed and compiled with the following command: Please, note the MIG Series7 
  only have to be generated if it is going to be used in the system.

  make map_xilinx_vhdl_lib
  make vsim
  make mig_series7

  Then rebuild the sofwtare and launch the simulator simulation:

  make soft
  make vsim-launch

  Modelsim v10.1 or newer is required and simulate Xilinx memory
  controller for Series 7.

  The normal leon3 test bench can be executed as the DDR3 model
  is pre-loading with the systest. A model of the DDR3 interface
  exist and can be used for faster simulations and software debug

* The application UART1 is connected to the USB/RS232 connector

* The JTAG DSU interface is enabled and accesible via the JTAG port.
  Start grmon with -xilusb to connect.

* Output from GRMON is:

 grmon -xilusb
