  Actel support is only available in commercial and FT distributions.

  Additional target technologies are available that are not selectable
  via the xconfig tool.

Ram library
CONFIG_MEM_VIRAGE
  Select RAM generators for ASIC targets.

Transceiver type
CONFIG_TRANS_GTP0
  Select the transceiver type used in your FPGA

Infer ram
CONFIG_SYN_INFER_RAM
  Say Y here if you want the synthesis tool to infer your
  RAM automatically. Say N to directly instantiate technology-
  specific RAM cells for the selected target technology package.

Infer pads
CONFIG_SYN_INFER_PADS
  Say Y here if you want the synthesis tool to infer pads.
  Say N to directly instantiate technology-specific pads from
  the selected target technology package.

No async reset
CONFIG_SYN_NO_ASYNC
  Say Y here if you disable asynchronous reset in some of the IP cores.
  Might be necessary if the target library does not have cells with
  asynchronous set/reset.

Scan support
CONFIG_SYN_SCAN
  Say Y here to enable scan support in some cores. This will enable
  the scan support generics where available and add logic to make
  the design testable using full-scan.

Use Virtex CLKDLL for clock synchronisation
CONFIG_CLK_INFERRED
  Certain target technologies include clock generators to scale or
  phase-adjust the system and SDRAM clocks. This is currently supported
  for Xilinx, Altera and Proasic3 FPGAs. Depending on technology, you
  can select to use the Xilinx CKLDLL macro (Virtex, VirtexE, Spartan1/2),
  the Xilinx DCM (Virtex-2, Spartan3, Virtex-4), the Xilinx PLLE2 (Virtex-7,
  Kintex-7, Artix-4), the Altera ALTDLL (Stratix, Cyclone),the 
  Proasic3 PLL or the NanoXplore-NX_PLL.
  Choose the 'inferred' option to skip a clock generator.

Clock multiplier
CONFIG_CLK_MUL
  When using the Xilinx DCM, Xilinx PLLE2 or Altera ALTPLL, 
  the system clock can be multiplied with a factor of 2 - 32, 
  and divided by a factor of 1 - 32. This makes it possible to 
  generate almost any desired processor frequency. When using 
  the Xilinx CLKDLL generator, the resulting frequency scale f
  actor (mul/div) must be one of 1/2, 1 or 2. On Proasic3, 
  the factor can be 1 - 128. 
  When using NanoXplore-NXPLL the frequency of the generated clock is
  out_freq  = (in_freq*mul*2)/ (2^clk_odiv)  if in_freq < 100 MHz
  out_freq  = (in_freq*mul)/ (2^clk_odiv)    if in_freq > 100 MHz
  mul can be in range 1-15  

  WARNING: The resulting clock must be within the limits specified
  by the target FPGA family.

Clock divider
CONFIG_CLK_DIV
  When using the Xilinx DCM, Xilinx PLLE2 or Altera ALTPLL, 
  the system clock can be multiplied with a factor of 2 - 32, 
  and divided by a factor of 1 - 32. This makes it possible to 
  generate almost any desired processor frequency. When using 
  the Xilinx CLKDLL generator, the resulting frequency scale f
  actor (mul/div) must be one of 1/2, 1 or 2. On Proasic3, 
  the factor can be 1 - 128. 
  
  WARNING: The resulting clock must be within the limits specified
  by the target FPGA family.

Output clock divider
CONFIG_OCLK_DIV
  When using the Proasic3 PLL, the system clock is generated by three
  parameters: input clock multiplication, input clock division and
  output clock division. Only certain values of these parameters
  are allowed, but unfortunately this is not documented by Actel.
  To find the correct values, run the Libero Smartgen tool and
  insert you desired input and output clock frequencies in the
  Static PLL configurator. The mul/div factors can then be read
  out from tool. 
  When using NanoXplore-NXPLL the frequency of the generated clock is
  out_freq  = (in_freq*mul*2)/ (2^clk_odiv)  if in_freq < 100 MHz
  out_freq  = (in_freq*mul)/ (2^clk_odiv)    if in_freq < 100 MHz


Output clock divider, 2nd clock
CONFIG_OCLKB_DIV
  See help for 'Ouput division factor'. Set this to 0 to disable the
  second clock output.

Output clock divider, 3rd clock
CONFIG_OCLKC_DIV
  See help for 'Ouput division factor'. Set this to 0 to disable the
  third clock output.

System clock multiplier
CONFIG_CLKDLL_1_2
  The Xilinx CLKDLL can scale the input clock with a factor of 0.5, 1.0, 
  or 2.0. Useful when the target board has an oscillator with a too high 
  (or low) frequency for your design. The divided clock will be used as the
  main clock for the whole processor (except PCI and ethernet clocks).

System clock multiplier
CONFIG_DCM_2_3
  The Xilinx DCM and Altera ALTDLL can scale the input clock with a large
  range of factors. Useful when the target board has an oscillator with a 
  too high (or low) frequency for your design. The divided clock will
  be used as the main clock for the whole processor (except PCI and 
  ethernet clocks). NOTE: the resulting frequency must be at least
  24 MHz or the DCM and ALTDLL might not work.

Enable CLKDLL for PCI clock
CONFIG_PCI_CLKDLL
  Say Y here to re-synchronize the PCI clock using a 
  Virtex BUFGDLL macro. Will improve PCI clock-to-output 
  delays on the expense of input-setup requirements.

Use PCI clock system clock
CONFIG_PCI_SYSCLK
  Say Y here to the PCI clock to generate the system clock.
  The PCI clock can be scaled using the DCM or CLKDLL to 
  generate a suitable processor clock.

External SDRAM clock feedback
CONFIG_CLK_NOFB
  Say Y here to disable the external clock feedback to synchronize the
  SDRAM clock. This option is necessary if your board or design does not
  have an external clock feedback that is connected to the pllref input
  of the clock generator.

Cachebility mapping
CONFIG_L2_MAP
  This 16-bit hexadecimal vaule defines which address areas
  are to be cacheable by the L2 cache. Each bit set indicates
  a cacheable 256 Mbyte block. The left-most bit (LSB) indicates
  address 0 - 256M and so on.

RAM sharing

  enable the GRETH Ethernet MAC for this option to become active.

Size of EDCL trace buffer
CONFIG_DSU_ETHSZ1
  Select the buffer size (in kbytes) for the EDCL. 1 or 2 kbyte is
  usually enough, while a larger buffer will increase the transfer rate.
  When operating at 100 Mbit, use a buffer size of at least 8 kbyte for

  one AHB master interface to read and write packets to memory, and one
  APB slave interface for accessing the control registers. 

Gaisler Ethernet 1G MAC enable
CONFIG_GRETH_GIGA
  Say Y here to enable the Gaisler Research 1000 Mbit Ethernet MAC . 
  The 1G MAC is only available in the commercial version of GRLIB,
  so do NOT enable it if you are using the GPL version.

  programmable as input or output. The port signals can also serve
  as interrupt inputs.

GPIO port witdth
CONFIG_GRGPIO_WIDTH
  Number of bits in the I/O port. Must be in the range of 1 - 32.

GPIO interrupt mask
CONFIG_GRGPIO_IMASK
  The I/O port interrupt mask defines which bits in the I/O port
  should be able to create an interrupt. 

UART debugging
CONFIG_DEBUG_UART
  During simulation, the output from the UARTs is printed on the
  simulator console. Since the ratio between the system clock and
  UART baud-rate is quite high, simulating UART output will be very
  slow. If you say Y here, the UARTs will print a character as soon
  as it is stored in the transmitter data register. The transmitter
  ready flag will be permanently set, speeding up simulation. However,
  the output on the UART tx line will be garbled.  Has not impact on
  synthesis, but will cause the LEON test bench to fail.

FPU register tracing
CONFIG_DEBUG_FPURF
  If you say Y here, all writes to the floating-point unit register file
  will be printed on the simulator console.
