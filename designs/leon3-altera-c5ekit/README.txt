Overview
--------

This LEON3 design is tailored for the Altera CycloneV E Development
kit and builds with Quartus 13.

Design contains:
  * LEON3 running at 95 MHz
  * 512 MiB DDR3 running at 300 MHz using Quartus soft memory controller IP
  * 256 MiB LPDDR2 running at 300 MHz using Quartus soft IP
  * JTAG debug link connected to on-board USB blaster II
  * One debug UART (AHBUART) and one standard UART (APBUART). Either
    connected to the serial port or the USB-to-UART converter on the
    board.
  * Memory controller to access the on-board flash via GRMON (read-only)
  * Two GRETH 10/100 Ethernet cores with EDCL


Important notes
---------------

  * The Ethernet interface needs to be changed to MII/GMII mode to be used
    with the GRETH. This can be done permanently by changing the R113/R114
    resistor on the board (see schematics). It can also be done temporarily
    (until next reset) through grmon by the following commands:

     for first Ethernet IF (on connector J8):
      wmdio 0 27 0x848f greth0; wmdio 0 0 0xb100 greth0

     for secondary Ethernet IF (on connector J9):
      wmdio 1 27 0x848f greth1; wmdio 1 0 0xb100 greth1

    Note: The EDCL blocks the MDIO interface until link has been established.
    Therefore, you may get "Timeout!" errors when doing the above commands
    if EDCL is enabled and the board has not yet been connected to anything.

  * The flash/SSRAM fm_d[2] pin has been located too close to the 125 MHz clock
    input in violation with the Cyclone V differential pin placement rules.
    Quartus 13.0SP1 refuses to build the design with this pin as output, and
    therefore the data bus has been configured as input only. That means you
    can still read the flash but it is not detected by the flash grmon command
    and it can not be written.


  * The flash memory is also used by the board's firmware and to store
    the FPGA designs. Only the PROM ranges 0x00000000-0x0003ffff and
    0x023C0000-03FDFFFF can be used for LEON3 boot code, the rest
    should be left untouched. If unsure, do not change the flash
    contents at all. See Appendix A of the board's User Guide for details.

Simulation
----------

The standard GRLIB flow with "make vsim" can be used to simulate the
design. The megafunctions are replaced with simple simulation models
that only simulate the minimum necesary to make the simulation work.


Programming
-----------

To synthesize the design, first build the megafunctions using "make
qwiz", then use the "make quartus" command to synthesize.

The "make quartus-prog-fpga" command has been tested to work with the
embedded USB-Blaster II interface on J10 (just needing a USB cable to
the computer). Programming through the JTAG connector has not been
tested.

Debugging can be done over the same interface using grmon -altjtag.

No make target to permanently store the design to flash has been
implemented. This can be done using the "design update portal" method
described in Appendix A in the board's user manual. To summarize:

  1. Use the sof2flash utility to generate a flash file for the design
  2. Power off the board. Set the "FAC_LOAD" (SW4:3) switch to on
     (left), connect the board to your network and power up the board
  3. Connect with a web browser to the IP address shown on the display
     and upload the flash file through the web interface.
  4. Power off the board, set the "FAC_LOAD" switch to off.

See Appendix A "Programming the Flash Memory Device" in the kit's user
manual for more details on how to do this.
