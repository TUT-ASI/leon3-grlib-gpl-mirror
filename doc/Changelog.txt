----------------------- Release 2022.2-b4274 ---------------------------

2022-06-21	SYNCFIFO_2P: Various fixes and updates to inferred FIFO:
		 - write-side empty (wempty) and read-side full (rfull) signals
		   did not immediately de-assert as expected after a write/read
		 - Fix so that the almost-empty flag accounts for the state of
		   the pipeline registers when pipelining is enabled
		   (piperead=1).
		 - Include the state of the pipeline registers in the write-side
		   empty indication when piperead=1
		 - Added rdhold generic that is passed through to the underlying
		   syncram_2p instances. Enabling this will cause the outputs to
		   remain valid after a read in fwft=0 mode.
		 - For simulation, make dataout go to U when data is not
		   guaranteed to be valid. This is to make it easier to detect
		   bugs in interfacing IP.

		- Corrected issue with a compressed hint instruction
		  (c.lui x0, v) and illegal instruction (c.fswsp without F)
		- Hypervisor TLB handling was not handled correctly when no PMP
		  was available. Handling of hPTEs (or PMP) entries smaller
		  than PTE entries could be handled incorrectly.
		- Bugfix related to PMP
		  Fixed issue with 0 at the top and for PMP TOR issues with
		  reverse and null range and handling of range top alignment
		  when the PMPADDR was not itself properly aligned
		- Bugfix related to FPU stalls and data forwarding.

		bit accesses in wide AMBA buses (AHBDW > 64)

2020-11-09	TECHMAP: Add gatedwr generic to syncram, syncram_dp,
		syncramft. When the generic set to 1, an access with
		enable=0,write=1 will not cause a write, gating logic
		will be added to technologies that require it.

2020-10-29	Add a GRLIB-global config option to keep clock
		polarity of inverted clocks inverted also in test mode.
		The JTAG TAP is updated to honor this config option,
		other IP with inverted clocks have not been updated.

2020-10-29	Add a separate trstmux entity to perform the muxing of
		testrst in test mode, in order to easier identify the
		muxes in the synthesis flow. The AHBJTAG and inferred
		JTAG TAP are updated to use this entity, other IP with
		async reset have not been updated.

2020-10-28	Endian-ness support updated to allow for designs where
		different AHB buses may have different endianness. All
		cores must still have the same endian-ness as the AHB
		bus(es) they are connected to. Existing designs do not
		need to be changed.

		On the AHBCTRL, an ahbendian generic is added to
		configure endianness of that AHB bus. If not set, this
		defaults to the global endian-ness setting in the grlib
		config package. The setting is communicated out via
		static signals added to the AHB master and slave
		records.

		IP cores supporting both big and little endian may
		adjust the endian-ness automatically based on the signal
		coming through the AMBA record. IP cores supporting only
		one endianness or with endian-ness configured via a
		separate generic with instead have a simulation assert
		to ensure the AMBA bus configuration seen through the
		records matches what the IP core expects.

2020-10-21	AHB2AXI3B/AHB2AXI4b: Bugfix. Address of a single write
		operation on AHB bus can be transferred wrongly to
		AXI bus on certain conditions. Refer to GRLIB-TN-0019.

2020-10-05	TECHMAP: Move the allx packages into separate alltech
		directory and build before inferred to fix file
		compilation order issue when recompiling previously

                When seperate debug bus is enabled, While connecting with
		grmon -ioarea 0xEFFFF000 flag must be used.

2020-01-30	LEON3: The SDIV/SDIVCC instruction produced incorrect
		results and/or condition codes for certain cases
		involving a 64-bit dividend outside the signed 32-bit
		range, and where the result is overflow or near-overflow.

		If the dividend is positive >= 2^31, the divisor is
		negative and the result is exactly the minimum negative
		integer, the correct result was returned but the overflow
		flag was set unexpectedly.

		If both the dividend and divisor are negative and should
		result in a positive overflow, the minimum negative
		integer was returned and the overflow did not get set.

		These cases are not known to be produced by existing
		compilers. Handwritten assembler routines could be affected.

2020-01-28	LEON3: Fix issue affecting only LDDEL=2
		configuration, where the CASA instruction would not
		update data cache contents with the new data after the

		only affects configuration with mmu=2 that was added
		in 2017.3-b4211.

2019-08-22	Template designs leon3-altera-c5ekit and
		leon3-terasic-sockit: irqi/irqo vectors were defined
		using "downto" instead of "to". This caused the wrong
		CPU to start up after reset for multiprocessor configs.

2019-08-21	LEON3: Fix issues related to multiply-accumulate (MAC)
		instructions. See note GRLIB-TN-0017 for details.

		with WCWP (bit 5) set would not work if the source
		register is given in the rs2 field in the opcode.

2019-08-08	LEON3: Make illegal DCTI couples such as bicc,bicc and
		bicc,jmpl behave consistently when branch prediction and
		DBPM are enabled.

2019-08-01	LEON3 template designs: Add new scheme for UART printing
		during simulation, based on programming UART to maximum
		speed together with a new uartprint module in the test
		bench that decodes the transmitted characters. This can
		replace the existing "accelerated UART tracing" option.
		Advantages of the new scheme are usability in gate level
		simulation, and compatibility with BCC2 binaries.
		Initially implemented on the LEON3MP, LEON3-ASIC and
		LEON3-GR-XC3S-1500 template designs.

2019-07-31	LEON3: Writes via the DSU to instruction trace control
		register 1 while the processor is running could fail if
		the write is done when the processor is held (i.e during
		cache miss).

		Add sepclk=2 option to syncram_2p/dp to indicate same clock
		but separate clock-gating (as used by LEON3).

		Add rdhold generic to hold read data when RAMs are disabled
		(done using register if not natively supported by tech).

		Add option to map small RAMs to inferred already at the
		wrapper layer (via syncram_abits_min vector in gencomp.vhd).

2018-12-19	GRPCI2: Configurations with FIFO number larger then 2 did
		not work correctly after the added support of gaiting cells
		in the CDC.

2018-12-19	GRPCI2: Bus parking feature was enabled in a target only

		HBURST_SINGLE write operations in order to increase the 
		performance with LEON3/4 processors. In addition a 
		configuration option added to allow outstanding writes 
		on the AXI bus to improve the performance.

2018-11-23	Added support for compiling different files with different
		settings for the VHDL standard in Mentor Modelsim and Aldec
		Riviera. This is done by setting the vhdlstd attribute on
		either single files, directories or libraries in GRLIB.
		Attributes are set after a library, directory or file name
		in libs.txt, dirs.txt, vhdlsyn.txt, vhdlsim.txt, vlogsyn.txt,
		and vlogsim.txt respectively. Attributes can also be added
		to local project files through the VHDLSYNFILES,
		VHDLOPTSYNFILES, VHDLSIMFILES, VHDLIPFILES, 
		VERILOGOPTSYNFILES, VERILOGSYNFILES and VERILOGSIMFILES
		variables. Default value for vhdlstd is 93.

		Note that as a result of this change, the files 
		describing the file tree structure can now only hold a
		single entry per row. If several entries are found on a
		single row, only the first is considered, while the rest
		are assumed to be attributes.

2018-01-26	LEON3/LEON4: Supervisor only bit is added to the
		L1 instruction cache and data cache tags when 
		mmuen generic is set to 2. When MMU is enabled, 
		this bit allows to check access permissions 
		fully when a load operation hits in the data cache 
		or an instruction access hits in the instruction cache. 
		This bit does not exist when mmuen generic is set to 1. 
		It is recommended to set mmuen generic to 2 if the MMU 
		is implemented.

		(on descriptor write) during bus wait-states (HREADY=0).

2017-09-22	Template designs using USB IP Cores (GRUSBHC, GRUSBDC and
		GRUSB_DCL) updated to support the new generic/port declaration
		list as a consequence of an update in the internal reset
		strategy.

2017-08-28	LEON3: Bugfix for a potential processor hang problem when 
		MMU is enabled and a load operation is followed by an atomic 
		instruction (SWAP, LDSTUB, CASA). In order for the problem 
		to trigger the following conditions must be met:
		1. MMU is enabled.
		1. MMU is enabled.
		2. A load instruction is followed by an atomic instruction
		immediately in the instruction flow without any additional
		instructions inbetween.
		3. The load instruction must cause a data cache miss and
		atomic instruction must cause a DTLB miss.
		4. When the load instruction causes a data cache miss, the
		store buffer must be full.
		If all the previously defined conditions are met, the processor
		will hang and the bus will remain locked. This issue is
		present in all LEON3 designs since GRLIB build b4108.

2017-08-17	LEON3: Support using memories with byte mask for DCache data,
		if supported by technology.

2017-08-15	LEON3: Bugfix for very rare case of dropping AHB lock. If MMU
		is enabled and two instructions after an atomic instruction
		causes an ITLB miss, the lock on the bus will be dropped before
		the store operation for the atomic instruction completes.

2017-08-14	LEON3: In double clocking configurations (clk2x /= 0), ensure
		AHB outputs come directly from registers to avoid risk of
		propagating glitches on the AHB outputs at fast clock edges.

2017-08-14	leon3-terasic-sockit, leon3-xilinx-xc7z020 : AHB2AXI bridge 
		in these template designs has been replaced with

2017-05-12	AHBSTAT: Extend to optionally support filtering and logging of 
		multiple errors.

2017-05-12	GRPCI2: Update to DMA descriptor handling.
		Added data descriptors was not always detected by the running
		DMA. The channel descriptor is now updated to point to the next
		data descriptor when disabled via the APB interface.

2017-05-08	LEON3/4: Bugfix for incorrect store address when MMU is enabled 
		and TLB is disabled. Only affected designs using separate TLB 
		with fast write option (TLB_TYPE= 2). The default value after 
		reset for TLB is enabled and existing designs that keep the TLB 
		enabled are not affected. This issue is present all LEON designs 
		with TLB_TYPE = 2 since GRLIB build 2627.
		 
2017-05-05	LEON3/LEON4: Avoid breaking into debug mode on RETT
		instructions because this causes incorrect behavior when
		resuming.

2017-05-03	scripts: Added file scriptgen_variable_values.tcl to pass
		environment variables to GRLIB scripts.

		technologies.

2016-09-10	LEON3: Instruction cache MMU and power-down improvement
		- Use MMU cacheability setting to enable/disable caching

		- Support disabling the Icache memories when Icache is disabled.
		  (non-trivial due to a corner case the cycle after enabling)

2016-08-30	LEON3: Bugfix for DPBM functionality. Affects LEON3

2016-01-08	Change script generation for Xilinx Vivado so that recent
		versions of Vivado use and generate a simulation file list
		with files in the correct order. Vivado 2014.1 reorders files
		incorrectly while later versions incorrectly re-orders files
		if source_mgmt_mode is set to prevent reordering(!). Current
		script leaves source_mgmt_mode at default (All) and produces
		correct file order with 2015.4. Vivado 2015.4 SIGSEVs during

		(dsnoop=1,2,5 but not dsnoop=6) since LEON3v3 required the
		syncram_dp to provide write-through behavior, which was not
		guaranteed. This could result in snooping miss in a corner case.
		Modify the syncram_dp entity in the techmap layer to emulate
		this functionality when needed in syncram_dp, in the same way
		as for syncram_2p.

2015-11-16	LEON3: Fix undriven signal used only in dsnoop=5 configuration.
