----------------------- Release 1.1.0-b4105 ----------------------------

2010-10-29	Added design for TerASIC Altera Cyclone-IV DE2-115 board

2010-10-29	Improved flow for Quartus-10

2010-10-14	DDR2SPA: Reimplement DDR2 controller to merge all data sizes.

----------------------- Release 1.1.0-b4102 ----------------------------

2010-10-12	Support for Xilinx ISE12 flow.

2010-10-01	Improved generation of Actel Libero project file to avoid
		large amount of bogus warnings.

2010-09-23	DDR2SPA: Support single-ended DQS for Virtex4-6

2010-09-12	GPTIMER: IP field in timer control register is now write-clear

2010-08-09	GRGPIO: Add generic to specify the first interrupt line the core
		should drive. Add support to dynamically specify the interrupt
		line to use for each GPIO line.

2010-06-28	Added Testbench framework for PCI.

2010-06-28	PCI_TARGET: Added support for PCI bus in big-little mode
		and support for byte and half word PCI accesses. 

2010-06-07      I2CMST/I2CSLV: Added generic that adjusts low-pass filter

2010-05-19      AHBJTAG: Use bit 32 in read data to indicate if AHB access has
                finished. Increased core version to 1.

2010-05-10      SPICTRL: Extended system test with test that uses an external
                simulation device. Function now has one additional argument.

2010-05-06      XST: Remove -read_cores yes from XST script generation as yes
                is the default read_cores setting. This allows specifying 
                -read_cores yes, no or optimize via the XSTOPT variable.

2010-05-05      FPU: GRFPU and GRFPU-lite netlists in both LEON3 and LEON4 
                versions are now available for Cyclone2, Cyclone3, Stratix2,
                Stratix3, Spartan3, Virtex2, Virtex4 and Virtex5.

2010-05-05      FPU: Always use FPU netlists in distributions lacking FPU 
                source code.

2010-05-05      FPU: Use EDIF netlists for FPU netlist synthesis on Xilinx

2010-03-21      Improved input data filtering in serial DSU link (DCOM_UART).

2010-02-15	Added template design for Xilinx SP601 Spartan6 board

2010-02-01	Support for 64- and 128-bit AHB buses
